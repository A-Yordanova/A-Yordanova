## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### My name is Anna Yordanova, and I am a Data Scientist!

I started my career in IT in 2012 as a QA engineer and eventually became an IT Product Owner. Throughout my journey, I realized that my true passion lies in data insights and numbers. I strongly believe in a data-driven approach to software development.

To pursue this passion, I completed an 8-month Data Science course, a 5-month Machine Learning Engineer course and participated in two projects for non-commercial organizations as a volunteer Data Scientist.

Now, as a full-time Data Scientist, I am excited to apply my detective mindset and knowledge to unravel all kinds of data challenges.

### Key Skills:
* **Python:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn (sklearn)`, `scipy`, `lightgbm`, `catboost`, `xgboost`, `fastapi`, `optuna`
* **Machine Learning:** `regression`, `classification`, `computer vision`, `natural language processing (NLP)`, `recommender systems`
