## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### My name is Anna Yordanova, and I am a Data Scientist!

I started my career in IT in 2012 as a QA engineer and eventually became an IT Product Owner. Throughout my journey, I realized that my true passion lies in data insights and numbers. I strongly believe in a data-driven approach to software development.

To pursue this passion, I studied Data Science at Yandex Practicum for 8 months. Now, I am excited and ready to apply my detective mindset and new knowledge to unravel all kinds of data challenges ahead!
