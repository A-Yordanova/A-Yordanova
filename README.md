## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### My name is Anna Yordanova, and I am a Data Scientist!

I started my career in IT in 2012 as a QA engineer and eventually became an IT Product Owner. Throughout my journey, I realized that my true passion lies in data insights and numbers. I strongly believe in a data-driven approach to software development.

To pursue this passion, I completed an 8-month Data Science course, a 5-month Machine Learning Engineer course and participated in two projects for non-commercial organizations as a volunteer Data Scientist.

Now, as an aspiring Data Scientist, I am excited to apply my detective mindset and knowledge to solve real-world problems.

### Key Skills:
* **Programming:** `Python` (`Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Scikit-learn`, `SciPy`, `LightGBM`, `CatBoost`, `XGBoost`, `Optuna`)
* **Machine Learning:** `Regression`, `Classification`, `Recommender Systems`, `Model Tuning and Evaluation`
* **Deep Learning (currently in training)**: `Neural Networks (FCNN, RNN, CNN, transformers)`, `Computer Vision`, `PyTorch`
* **Tools:** `GitHub`, `Jupyter`, `MLFlow`, `ClearML`
* **Other Skills:** `SQL`, `Analytical Thinking`, `Data Cleaning`, `Data Visualization`, `Presentation Design`
