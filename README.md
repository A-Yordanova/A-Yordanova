## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### My name is Anna Yordanova, and I am a Data Scientist!

I started my career in IT in 2012 as a QA engineer and eventually became an IT Product Owner. Throughout my journey, I realized that my true passion lies in data insights and numbers. I strongly believe in a data-driven approach to software development.

To pursue this passion, I studied Data Science at Yandex Practicum for 8 months. Now, I am excited and ready to apply my detective mindset and new knowledge to unravel all kinds of data challenges ahead!

### Key Skills:
* **Python:** `pandas` `numpy` `matplotlib` `seaborn` `scikit-learn (sklearn)` `scipy` `lightgbm` `catboost` `xgboost` `tensorflow.keras`
* **Machine Learning:** `Linear/Logistic regression` `SVM` `Decision Tree` `kNN` `neural networks` `KMeans` `Isolation Forest`
* **Other Techniques:** `statistical tests` `bootstrap` `gradient boosting`
* **Environments:** `Jupyter Notebook` `Anaconda`
